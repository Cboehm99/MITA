90 Second Pitch for 9/28/2020 Class:

What is the need?
- people who are studying some form of medicine may want an app like this to practice and help them learn how to recognize patterns in scans
- people who are getting scans of themselves may want to know how to read their own scans, since blindly trusting what a doctor tells you can be scary

Who are the users:
i kinda just said this but
- people studing some form of medicine
- people getting scans taken

What was our inspiration:
- Yi Ni worked on a study that did this
- Audrey worked at Medtronic and is interested in medical things
- in terms of other applications, there are apps for learning chess very similiar to what we are trying to do
