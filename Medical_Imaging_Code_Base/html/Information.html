	  <h1>Perceptual Learning</h1>
	  <div class = "learning-info">
		  Humans are excellent at perceptual learning. Given appropriate experience, humans will tend to drastically improve in their ability to make sense of what they see, hear, feel, taste or smell. Extensive research has shown that practice yields highly specific perceptual learning of simple visual properties such as orientation and contrast. These studies show that practice on simple stimuli such as Gabor patches or moving dots lead to improved orientation, contrast, or motion sensitivity. Further studies have also shown that people can acquire expertise in complex domains, such as in chess and medical imaging.
