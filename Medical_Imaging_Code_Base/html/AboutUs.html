	<h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>
        We are a group of students at the University of Minnesota taking a User Interface Design class. We aim to create an application that will help train people to read and interpret chest X-rays. This project is inspired by a practical need in the medical field. Many diseases, including lung cancer, are diagnosed with X-ray images. However, miss rates are often high. One of the goals of our training application is to complement the current training of radiology students. Radiologists, like most medical professionals, are currently primarily trained using an apprenticeship model, learning directly from experience while supervised by a more experienced radiologist. We hope that our training could provide another avenue to practice these skills. Another goal of our project is to allow those without any medical knowledge an opportunity to familiarize themselves with chest X-rays, or to learn how to differentiate lung cancer X-rays from normal chest X-rays. However, it is important to note that this application does not provide formal medical training and is not a substitute for a professional's knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our application is built on the principle of perceptual learning. Perceptual learning aims to teach better differentiation between categories of visual, auditory, or other sensory experience; in our case, training to perceive the features and differences in chest X-rays. Chess learning applications are built using similar principles.
